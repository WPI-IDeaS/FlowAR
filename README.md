# FlowAR
FlowAR is an augmented reality program that teaches flow chemistry using the Microsoft HoloLens 2. This GitHub repository contains the Unity project for FlowAR, including scripts, models, and textures.

## System Overview
In the application, you will be able to see 3 large panels. The left one is the menu panel, where you can change settings. The Step by Step animation will be played in front of the middle panel. And the text instruction will be displayed on the right panel.

### Step by Step Animation
Most of the interactions in this application can be achieved by voice command. You can say “next” to go through the Step-by-Step assembly instruction, and the command “back” to go back to the previous step.

### Setting
To change the settings, you can say “setting”. Then, on the left panel, you can use the airtap gesture to click and select the voice you like, or pinch and drag the slide bar to adjust the volume of the background music and the narration.
